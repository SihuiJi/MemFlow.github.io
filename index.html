            MemFlow maintains long-range consistency and semantic coherence in challenging cases, including camera movement, character insertion, and scene switching. In the first 0–10 seconds of the long video, the scene contains only a single subject. Between 10–20 seconds, <strong>a new subject enters the scenario</strong>. From 20–40 seconds, multiple subjects interact while each maintains its own visual consistency—exhibiting neither drifting nor identity confusion. Between 40–50 seconds, the camera angle changes, with <strong>some subjects temporarily moving out of view</strong>. At 50–60 seconds, the viewpoint returns to its original position, and the subjects still <strong>preserve the same characteristics</strong> they had before the camera switch, highlighting our advantage in long context memory.
